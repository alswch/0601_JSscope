Scope/DOM/Event Mini Challenges
Goal:
Demonstrate understanding of DOM manipulation and events. Build familiarity with JS syntax.

Assignment:
Complete and submit the following three exercises to go over JavaScript event binding:

== arguing buttons
• Create an HTML page with two buttons that argue with each other.
    When one button is clicked, the text "I'm right" should appear in a text display div
    When the other button is clicked, the text is replaced with, "No, I'm right!"

== don't hover over me element
• Add a large element to the page that says "Don't hover over me" inside of it.
    When you hover over the element, trigger an alert box that says, "Hey, I told you not to hover over me!"

== keypress display
• Add an h1 display tag to the page
• Add a javascript event listener that listens for a keypress.
    When the user presses that key, the text of the h1 should show the value of the key.
    Example: If the user presses "J", the text inside the h1 should be "J".

== username/password form validation
• Add a form to the page.
    The form should include inputs for username and password
    Add a button to the bottom of the form
• Add javascript code that does the following things when the button is pressed:
    checks that the password is 12345678
    checks that the username is less than 14 characters in length
• If the info in the form is correct, change the h1 text to say "Congrats on knowing your username and password!"
• If anything is wrong, send an alert message saying "Incorrect username or password"

Grading criteria:
Code has a comment that notes which problem the code snippet is attempting to solve.
All solutions should explicitly fulfill the requirements noted in each problem.
Complete = Meets all grading criteria above.
Incomplete = Does not meet all grading criteria above. Needs improvement or missing submission.
